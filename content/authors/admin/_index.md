 Howdy! I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Texas A&M University, supervised by Dr. Ali Mostafavi. I also closely work with Dr. Xia "Ben" Hu (TAMU), Dr. Jianxi Gao (RPI), and Dr. Ruihong Huang (TAMU) from Computer Science. 
 My research focuses on quantifying human dynamics in risky and uncertain situations and integrating artificial and human intelligence for community resilience.
